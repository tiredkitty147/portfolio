                        of CSCI1300:
                        User Interface and User Experiences course at Brown University.
                        Our task was to design an interactive interface for an emerging startup,
                        going through the full process of mocking up a solution to the startup's concept.
                        We chose hello as our startup.
                    </p>
                    <p class="introduction-parag">
                        Hello is a search engine that is optimized for developers and technical questions.
                        It answers questions with simple explanations and code snippets from the web instantly.
                        Hello uses AI language models to quickly generate answers based on multiple resources.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>


            <div class="container-2">
                <h1 class="part-1-title">Wireframing</h1>
                <div class="part-1-col-1">
                    <h1 class="sub-title">Pre-design Thinking</h1>
                    <p>
                        The intended audience of hello consists of developers and computer science students/
                        professionals.
                        They can use hello to receive fast answers to their technical questions.
                        Because of the coding nature of the startup, we chose to design a desktop interface.
                        Using this as a jumping-off point, we had discussions to decide which features would be the most
                        beneficial for our website.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In this session, we concluded:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>The website should include a split screen including both 'hello' answers, and the web
                            results. This would
                            provide all the necessary tools and resources for developers.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The user should be able to switch between 'hello' answers and the web results.
                        </li>
                        <li>There should be an option to filter for programming languages as it would bring the most
                            relevant
                            results for the developer.
                        </li>

                    </ul>

                    <h1 class="sub-title">Combining Ideas into a Wireframe</h1>
                     <p>To get the ideas flowing, each group member made quick hand-drawn sketches.</p>
                     <img src="./pics/sketches.jpg" style="width:100%;" alt="Wireframes Presentation">

                    <p>
                        After the sketching, we came up with a new design to demonstrate our startup company's
                        goals in the best way possible. We wanted our design to be simple, intuitive, and easy to use.
                        Furthermore, we wanted a clean yet unique look, which separated our startup's project from other
                        search engines available.
                    </p>
                    <p> We used Figma to create the low-fidelity wireframe of our design.</p>

                    <h1 class="sub-title">Designing The First High-Fidelity Prototype</h1>
                    <p>
                        Using Figma, we created our first interactive high-fidelity prototype.
                        While making our design, we choose a clean look with minimal distractions.
                        We chose our fonts to reflect the startup's technical nature.
                        We paid special attention to text hierarchy and color scheme to make our page easy to read and
                        navigate.
                        By using contrasting colors, such as black text on a blue background, we made the font more
                        visible so that anyone could read the website.
                        We chose to use icons on our website to express possible actions, such as bookmarking and
                        history, to grab the user's
                        attention and help the users find the content they are looking for. We made sure to use icons
                        that the user can
                        easily understand. We added a split screen option for users to view 'Web Answers' and 'Hello
                        Answers',
                        which are generated simultaneously by hello's AI algorithm.

                                We asked for peer critiques to identify potential problems with our high-fidelity
                                mockup.
                                Below are some issues that were identified:

                                <li>We have to have more consistent between different display options.</li>
                                <li>There should be a way to go back to home page.</li>
                                <li>Hello's logo should always be on the page.</li>
                                <li>There were some problems with the text hierarchy.</li>

                                <li>There should be a way to see recently visited pages.</li>

                                We made the following changes to our initial high-fi mockup after receiving feedback from peers:

                                <li>Fixed font hierarchy problems</li>
                                <li>Added text to the “split screen” icon to make it clearer</li>
                                <li>Highlighted the selected display option</li>
                                <li>Changed the “languages” tab to be consistent on all pages</li>
                                <li>Added a bookmarks (list) and search history icons</li>

                        With a functioning and updated prototype, we wrote a task and carried out usability testing
                        to analyze which difficulties might exist when the user interacts with the interface. 
                        We asked the users to imagine themselves as a computer science student and search for 
                        “how to implement Dijkstra's algorithm” by following some task 
                        instructions which we have given. We asked them to verbalize their thoughts throughout the testing process.
                        We informed them that they would not be using an actual website but instead testing an
                        interactive mockup.

                        Overall, our UserTesting results were in line with our expectations.
                        The users didn't have difficulty in completing the tasks and found our design intuitive.
                        The users generally understood the layout and purpose of the website just from looking
                        at the homepage. Some thought that the split screen was effective and
                        helpful. The users also mentioned that the answers generated by the algorithm including the quick answer
                        and the code snippets met their expectations. They appreciated the minimal design of 'Hello
                        Answers' page as there were no distractions.
                        Some users mentioned that they were expecting to be a profile button on the homepage. They also 
                        added that they wished to see more languages for filtering.

                        Based on the feedback, we would definitely give less space to the web results.
                        It was mentioned multiple times that the main draw of the platform is the hello answers,
                        so the web answers can be deprioritized since users can just go to Google if they wanted that.

                        Additionally, we could include a dropdown arrow after a language
                        is chosen from the “see more” dropdown to show that users can change languages if they make a
                        mistake.
