                    <p class="introduction-parag">Responsive Redesign is a project I have completed as a part
                        of CSCI1300:
                        User Interface and User Experiences course at Brown University.
                        In this project, the task was to practice the workflow of redesigning 
                        a simple website and coding one page of this website taking accesibility and responsiveness into account. 
                        I chose Yahoo.com as the website I wanted to 
                        redesign, identified the problems existing on this interface, 
                        created prototypes for various screens, and build a responsive website based on these prototypes.
                        Yahoo! is a portal that contains a search engine and other services such as mail, news coverage, politics, 
                        finance, weather forecast, and such.

                <div class="part-1-col-1">
                    <h2 class="sub-title">Original Webpage</h2>
                    <p>
                        I chose Yahoo.com (home page) to analyze based 
                        on usability and accessibility standards. Yahoo is the 
                        least used search engine amongst others and I wanted to figure out 
                        how could it be improved so that more people use it. I started examining the home page to find the problems existing on 
                        the website to figure out why it is one of the least used search engines. 
                    </p>
                    <p>Below, you can view how Yahoo's homepage looks like currently. The website can also be reached at <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/" target="_blank">https://www.yahoo.com/</a></p>

                    <h2 class="sub-title">Problems of The Website</h2>

                    <h3 class="sub-sub-title">Usability Issues</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>There is too much text on the page.</li>
                            <li>There are too many different items to navigate. This makes the readers take much more
                                time to read and understand the website's content. The users can have a hard time finding the information they are looking for.</li>
                            <li>The images of news and ads are cluttered.</li>
                            <li>The section on the right is very cluttered.</li>
                            <li>The website is difficult to navigate and it does not have a clear page structure. 
                                There is no hierarchy. It is hard to differentiate what's important and what's less important.
                            </li>
                            <li>There are repetitive links. There is a button for 'mail' twice.</li>
                            <li>It is a never-ending home page and the user can scroll down forever.</li>
                            <li>It is hard to learn and remember the page because it is too crowded.</li>
                            <li>The search bar is not so obvious and be missed because of the other distractions on the webpage.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="sub-sub-title"> Accessibility Issues</h3>
                        <ul> 
                            <li>Some text on the website have very low color contrast. The choice of font and color for most of the text is poor.
                                Most of the text font is really small 
                                and this makes it harder to read. For example, the subtitles above images that indicate which section the information belong to
                                are light gray and has very small font size and thin font weight; therefore, they have a pretty low contrast on top of the white background. 
                            </li>
                            <li>Most of the images does not have alternative text for users who cannot view them.</li>
                            <li>Some buttons are empty or have no value text. </li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="sub-sub-title"> Conceptual Issues</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>This is the homepage for the Yahoo and it has a search bar at the top and a navigation bar right under that, which follows the 
                                general model for a search engine. 
                            </li>
                            <li>However, the homepage contains too much information such as news even though Yahoo has a sepearte page for the news section.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="sub-sub-title">WebAIM WAVE Accesibility</h3>
                        <p>
                            The Wave Accessibilty tool is used to identify accesibility errors. By using this tool, I was able to identify the errors I had mentioned about
                            such as missing alternative texts for images, contrast issues, small text, and empty buttons. 
                        </p>
                        
                        <p> The website's overall usability is poor. Usability is a quality that measures how easy 
                            to use a user interface. Usability is defined by components such as learnability, 
                            efficiency, and memorability. If I look at the learnability attribute for Yahoo.com, 
                            I can see that the Yahoo homepage is unfortunately not so easy for users to navigate and 
                            accomplish tasks when they first encounter the website. It takes longer for users to learn the website. Therefore, I can say that the efficiency of the website is poor because even though the users learn the website, it is still hard to perform basic tasks such as differentiating between ads and news, logging in to mail, or navigating through the website. The homepage also has poor memorability because the structure is confusing, crowded, and not consistent.
                            It could be hard for users to reestablish proficiency after some period of time not using it.  
                        </p>
                </div>
            </div>


            <div class="container-2">
                <h1 class="part-1-title">Wireframing</h1>
                <div class="part-1-col-1">
                    <h2 class="sub-title">Pre-design Thinking</h2>
                    <p>
                        The intended audience of Yahoo! consists of people who use the internet on a daily basis. People who email, 
                        read the news, follows politics, finance or sports and wants to learn about the weather would be using Yahoo! frequently.
                        Basically, Yahoo! would target everyone who is be using a search engine.
                        The users can visit Yahoo! on their laptops, mobile phones or tablets. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Using this information as a jumping-off point, I concluded that:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>The website shouldn't be complex. It should be easy to learn and use every day.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The home page should include only the most important information. The user should not be distracted by unnecessary content and be able to 
                            customize their homepage by signing in.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The search bar should be centered to draw the user's attention.
                        </li>

                    </ul>

                    <h2 class="sub-title">Combining Ideas into a Wireframe</h2>

                    <p>
                        I wanted the new design to be simple, intuitive, and easy to use.
                        Furthermore, I wanted a clean look, which would include less content and information.
                    </p>
                    <p> Using Figma, I created a total of 3 wireframes of my screen, 
                        one for each of the screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop). Below is how the new design would look like for the
                        desktop.
                    </p>
                    <img class="dekstop-wireframe" style="width:100%;" src="./pics/Group 7.jpg" alt="Low-fi Desktop">

                    <p> For the tablet and mobile screens, the responsive navigation bar turns into a menu (three bars). The 
                        content lines up vertically so that it fits the screen better. The one on the right is the low-fidelity wireframe for
                        tablet screen and the left one is for the mobile screen.

                        <p>
                            Using Figma, I created a visual design style guide that displays
                            the main colors, typography, and reusable components' different states (buttons on hover, click, etc.).

                    <h2 class="sub-title">Designing The High-Fidelity Frame</h2>
                    <p>
                        Using Figma, I created a high-fidelity prototype.
                        While making the new design, I chose a clean look with minimal distractions.
                        I paid attention to text hierarchy and color scheme to make our page easy to read and
                        navigate.
                        By using contrasting colors, such as black and purple text on a white background, I made sure that the font is
                        visible and anyone could read the website.
                        I chose to put the navigation bar on top of the search bar to make it easily accessible and help the users find the content they are looking for. 
                        I put only the trending news and the weekly weather forecast on the home page so that the page doesn't have many distractions.

                    <p>
                        In this project, I was able to focus on the responsiveness of a website. My goal was to build a website that detects the user's screen size
                        and change the layout of the design accordingly. Responsive redesign of Yahoo allows the user to freely choose the
                        screen size they want to view the webpage on. The responsiveness of the website I created enables the website to look great 
                        on all screen resolutions, sizes, and devices. It provides the most effective use of the website and the best user experience. 
                        Moreover, this makes it unneeded to create different versions of my website for tablet and mobile screens and
                        helps me save time.
